# Soft Internship Tasks

## Overview

This repository captures the work completed during a 1-month internship at Soft, focusing on three key tasks: Titanic Survival Prediction, Movie Rating Prediction, and Iris Flower Classification. The datasets for these tasks were obtained from Kaggle.

## Tasks

### 1. Titanic Survival Prediction

- **Task Description:**
  Predict survival on the Titanic based on passenger information.

- **Files:**
  - `titanic_survival_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook
  - `titanic_dataset.csv`: Titanic dataset from Kaggle.

- **Approach:**
  Utilized machine learning techniques to build a predictive model for passenger survival.

### 2. Movie Rating Prediction

- **Task Description:**
  Predict movie ratings using a given dataset.

- **Files:**
  - `movie_rating_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook
  - `movie_ratings_dataset.csv`: Movie ratings dataset from Kaggle.

- **Approach:**
  Implemented a machine learning model to predict movie ratings based on relevant features.

### 3. Iris Flower Classification

- **Task Description:**
  Classify Iris flowers into species based on sepal and petal measurements.

- **Files:**
  - `iris_flower_classification.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook
  - `iris_dataset.csv`: Iris flower dataset from Kaggle.

- **Approach:**
  Developed a classification model using machine learning to accurately classify Iris flowers.
